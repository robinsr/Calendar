Calendar
========

A Simple web calendar in the vein of TodoMVC

See the demo: https://robinsr-calendar.herokuapp.com/

I want to remake this app using various technologies/frameworks to showcase
the differences in implementation between them. 

The basic requirements for each version are as follows:

* Should render
* It should look nice
* Days should be numbered correctly
* Days in the month should be visually distinct from leading/trailing days
* Days should list events that happen on that day
* Clicking an event shows a detail modal
* Dragging an event to a different day moves the event and updates the event details

Extras:

* It should look _really_ nice, and have animations
* It should be modular with some sort of build system
* It should have some sort of URL routing
* It should have tests
* It should load events from a service
* It should persist changes to events
* It should allow additional events to be added
