Calendar

App to convert Excel CSV to web calendar

See the demo: https://robinsr-calendar.herokuapp.com/

Update: 9/26/2015

I want to remake this app using various technologies/frameworks to showcase
the differences in implementation between them. For now, I plan to remake the
app in three ways

* Vanila JS using an object-oriented approach
* Knockout.js with require.js
* Backbone with require

The basic requirements for each version are as follows:

* Render a calendar:
    * Days should be numbered correctly
    * Days in the month should be yellow, while days outside of the month are gray
    * Days should show events that happen on that day

* Interaction
    * Clicking an event shows a detail modal
    * Dragging an event to a different day moves the event and updates the event details

TODOS

* ~~Backbone~~
* Angular
* Ember
* React/Flux
* web components
